## 💡 About the project

> _get_next_line is an individual project designed to practice file I/O in C by creating a function that reads a file (or any stream) line by line. This function is crucial for projects that need to process input incrementally, and it builds a deeper understanding of buffer management, memory allocation, and efficient reading in C._

#### 🚀 Bonus
- [x] Multiple file descriptor can be read

For more detailed information, see the [**subject of this project**](https://github.com/jonona912/42_get_next_line/blob/main/get_next_line_subject.pdf).

## 🛠️ Usage

### Requirements

This project is written in C and requires the **`gcc` compiler** and standard **C libraries**.

### Instructions

**1. Compiling the project**

To compile, navigate to the project directory and compile the files with your own filename or uncomment the sample main function and compile:

```shell
$ cc [filename] [filename] ...
```

**2. Using get_next_line in your code**

To use the function, simply include its header:

```c
#include "get_next_line.h"
```

## 📚 What I Learned
- I realized the value of discussing problems with peers. Even with a solid understanding, I was stuck until a conversation sparked the solution
- I became much more confident working with linked lists
- File I/O in C (open, read, close)
- Handling static variables
- Dynamic memory allocation and buffer management
- Efficient reading and string manipulation
